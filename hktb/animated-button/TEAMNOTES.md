<h1>Team Notes</h1>
We met Monday (9/20) in order to work on the button together. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Learned today (9/21)</b>
<br>
We learned how to edit the demo files for better tests. Our only work had previously been in the src.
<br>
<br>
<b>Next steps</b>
<br>
Next we will try to fix our naming convenion issues. The underscore was a typo that has created many problems. I would also like to try to edit the style of the button to look a little more like the one we based it off of.
